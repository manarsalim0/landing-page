# Landing Page Project
This is my first project, titled Landing Page
* I used the starter code and then added the project requirements * 

1. A total of 5Â sections have been added to the page.
2. Navigation is constructed as an unordered list dynamically.
3. While scrolling down the website, it is obvious which area is being seen.
4. When you select an item from the navigation menu, the link will automatically scroll to the appropriate .area.


The methods used:
1. createNavBar()
2. activeSection()
3. activeItemInNaveBar()
4. ScrollToSectionOnLinkClick()
5. navBarStyle()
6. navBarActivListItemStyle()
7. navBarUnActivListItemsStyle()

Using languages : HTML,CSS,JavaScript.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
